# BitBot
BitBot is a Discord bot that only answers Yes or No.

After adding BitBot to your Discord Server, call it with !bit 
The command prefix is configurable in the config.json file if you clone this repository.

After hearing its name, BitBot will reply with a random "Yes" or "No" and a random emote that matches.
The command can be placed anywhere in your message but cannot at this time be followed by any punctuation.

Thanks and enjoy BitBot.
